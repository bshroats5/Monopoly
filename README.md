# Monopoly Project

# Overview
I wanted to do this project after I lost a game to my 7 year old daughter and I do not want to ever lose another game. I set out to answer three questions abot the game of Monopoly. I play way to much of this game on my phone and with board game to ever lose to my child again. 

# Program Features

The first question was what is the most valuable color set to buy in the game. I had believed it was the Orange properties but I wanted data to confirm my belief or educate me on what is the true best color set in the game. 

The second question is the inverse of the first question. What is the worst property to invest in during the game? My assumption had always been it was the Brown color set but again wanted a data driven decison to confirm my belief.

The third question was if I am unavailable then what color sets should I go after or to try and collect to give my self the best chance to win.
